    <h2>What makes a superhero?</h2>
      <p>A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person couldn’t. 
          So in order to be a superhero,<strong>you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal human being could possess</strong>, 
          and <strong>you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds</strong>. Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero. 
          For instance, a <i>good guy</i> fighting a <i>bad guy</i> could be just a regular police story or detective story or human-interest story. 
          But if it’s a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story. If the good guy is doing something that 
          a normal human being couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.

     <p>Rogue</p>
     <p>
        Rogue is part of a subspecies of humans called mutants, who are born with superhuman abilities. Rogue has the involuntary ability to absorb and sometimes also remove the memories, physical strength, and superpowers of anyone she touches. 
        Therefore, Rogue considers her powers to be a curse. For most of her life she limited her physical contact with others, including her on-off love interest and eventual husband, Gambit. However, after many years, Rogue finally gained full 
        control over her mutant ability.
